Basically when I want to post a article, I need to do these things:

1. Write a blog in a certain format in a local editor.
2. May be rendering in the local computer to see if things are right.
3. Uploading the article to the server using some tools.
4. Check if things goes right on server.

Despite it's really cubersome,  I have to keep a copy of the post in order one day I want to modify. I am a computer practitioner, which I am really hate to maintain the consistency of data. I wish my data is always consistent.

So, here is jekyll_admin.
